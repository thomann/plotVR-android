# plotVR - Walk Through your Data in Cardboard VR in android

This is a prototype to get open your data in a Google Cardboard and (optionally)
navigate using the computer keyboard.
For more information on the desktop side go to <https://github.com/thomann/plotVR>.

At the moment this is only a prototype. An unsigned APK is provided at <https://github.com/thomann/plotVR-android/releases/download/v0.8/plotVR-debug.apk>.

For QR-Sanning a App has to be installed, I tested it only with the android app provided
by <https://github.com/zxing/zxing> (Cudos to them).

Please let me know of your impressions and have fun!
